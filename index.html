    The Big Brown Tree Across the Pond is Dead
  </h1>
<body>
The big brown tree across the pond is dead<br>
And I don’t feel slightly sorry for it.<br>
Dozens of feet high, no ‘giving tree’<br>
you were not a friend to me, <br>
though, <br>
I did cherish you.<br>
In a way.<br>
A centerpiece, a statuesque sort of being.<br>
Do you not know? Not understand?<br>
Oh how I hate you so.<br>
Hated. Sorry. Well I would be sorry. I am sorry.<br>
How I worshiped you, the church, the steeple, and the people<br>
all in the curve of your branches.<br>
I’m writing you a letter, though your towering height has become length.<br>
Speaking words at your funeral,<br>
your most devout servant.<br>
God knows he didn’t exist to me until now.<br>
God knows I have one prayer for him and it’s to<br>
stand you upright.<br>
Strong and tall.<br>
Powerful, I can’t see where you end.<br>
Your flowers land in the heavens.<br>
And I know you taunted my prayers above my head<br>
and I know you proceeded to throw them to the wind and tell me<br>
“Well. Let’s just see.”<br>
And then when I’d come back to the pond to fill it with tears of devotion and loathing,<br>
you told me — <br>
through your knots and ridges and your leaves drifting in the wind —<br>
“Though I am God,” you pictured yourself in a crown, “I am not enough to take a school girl's dreams and make them grow.”<br>
And so I hate you.<br>
And I’m glad you’re gone before I am,<br>
that you could suffer as I drank tea and laughed.<br>
But God knows I still don’t think he’s real,<br>
and God knows the offerings I laid at your roots will not be removed,<br>
and God knows that on my worst days I’ll still come to your stump,<br>
with my rosary and my rings,<br>
And I will pray to you.<br>
